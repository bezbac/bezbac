## ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm Ben


I'm a digital generalist, currently working towards my **BSc Software Engineering at CODE University** in Berlin.  
Next to studying, I work within early-stage startups, where I spend most of my time programming across the stack,  
but I enjoy the opportunity to work on design and product too.

ðŸ’¬ Currently I work on all things web-related @ **Superchat**
